There are TWO configuration files for this product! 

Configuration.default - this is the mgiconfig configuration file required for an MGI
    software product. Copy to Configuration and edit as needed. It basically sets some
    environment variables accessed in config.cfg

config.cfg - this contains most of the settings for the mgigff product. mgigff was developed
    independently of the MGI framework, and has always used Python's standard ConfigParser lib. 
    Parameter values in config.cfg can reference other parameters *or environment variables*
    by name. This is how the environment set up by mgiconfig makes its way into the config
    settings. For example:

    distributionPath=/pub/mgigff
    distributionDirectory=%(ftproot)s%(distributionpath)s

    Note the case. All variable references use lower case. (FIXME)

The default configuration for this product is for running in production mode (run on hobbiton,
distribute the results to the public ftp site).
